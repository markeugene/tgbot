My own tgbot for exam

This is my own Telegram bot, which should help me with me examination on Economics in my university.

I use library TELEBOT and Python.

In code you can see files like "1.txt","10.pdf".

They contain answers, so i did not downald them to GitHUb.

Main logic:

You should send number from 1 to 13 and bot should send you file with answer.
